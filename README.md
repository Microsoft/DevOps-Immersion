# DevOps-Immersion

## Introduction


### About the MyHealthClinic Project

The MyHealthClinic project contains 8 demos for different scenarios such as

begin with hosting a public website developed in ASP .NET 5 on Azure, and
then leverage the services to integrate with our mobile and wearable
apps built with Xamarin.
